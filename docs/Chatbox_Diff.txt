PROJECT CONTEXT — AI RESUME BUILDER (UI PHASE)

GOAL
Build a production-grade AI resume builder that:

* starts from natural language input
* extracts facts deterministically
* asks users for missing information
* generates a complete resume schema
* enhances wording using Gemini
* enforces quality gates
* outputs frontend-ready JSON
* supports multiple resume templates on the frontend

BACKEND STATUS
Backend is DONE, DEBUGGED, and PROVEN CORRECT.
All previous issues were state-mutation and wiring bugs and are now fixed.
Frontend work can begin safely.

NOTE: Backend, pipeline, and API logic are OUT OF SCOPE for this task.

---

TASK SCOPE (CRITICAL — READ FIRST)

Your task is ONLY to design and render the **Prompt Box UI** in the React frontend.

DO NOT:

* call any API
* trigger the pipeline
* implement submission logic
* add validation
* add streaming
* add smart behavior
* infer backend logic
* touch the FastAPI or NLP folder

This is a UI-only task.
Stop once the UI is complete.

---

FRONTEND CONTEXT

Frontend lives in:
my-resume-app/src

The UI layout has three panes:

* Left pane: manual input fields + preferences
* Center pane: resume preview
* Right pane: template selector

---

PROMPT BOX PURPOSE

The prompt box allows users to describe their resume in natural language.
It does NOT replace manual fields.
It does NOT trigger anything by itself.
It is simply an input surface.

---

PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS

* The prompt box must be rendered:

  * inside the LEFT pane
  * as the VERY LAST element
  * directly BELOW the Preferences section
* The left pane is scrollable
* The prompt box scrolls with the left pane
* The prompt box must NOT be sticky or fixed

---

COMPONENT STRUCTURE

* Create a reusable component, for example:
  src/components/PromptBox/PromptBox.js
* Styling may be colocated or reuse existing global styles
* Do NOT introduce a new design system

---

VISUAL DESIGN

* The prompt box must visually match existing input boxes
* Same spacing, borders, fonts, and colors
* Subtle emphasis is allowed (label or small icon)
* No flashy or experimental UI

---

INPUT SPECIFICATION

* Use a MULTILINE textarea
* Auto-grow vertically up to a reasonable maximum height
* Manual resize must be disabled
* No character counter

---

LABEL AND HELPER TEXT

Label (always visible):
AI Prompt

Helper / placeholder text:
“All fields shown in the center preview must be provided.”

Rules:

* Helper text is conditionally visible
* Controlled via a boolean prop (e.g. showHelperText)
* Prompt box does not decide when this appears

---

ERROR DISPLAY SLOT (RESERVE SPACE)

* Reserve space DIRECTLY BELOW the prompt box
* This space is for error text (future use)
* Error text styling:

  * red
  * inline
* Layout must NOT jump when error appears
* Error content is controlled via a prop
* No error logic is implemented in this task

---

COMPONENT API (UI ONLY)

The component should accept props similar to:

* value
* onChange
* showHelperText
* errorMessage

The component must NOT:

* manage business logic
* decide when to submit
* decide when errors appear

---

ACCESSIBILITY

* Label must be programmatically associated with the textarea
* Placeholder must not be the only instruction
* Keyboard focus order must respect pane order

---

EXPLICIT NON-GOALS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)

* No API calls
* No pipeline execution
* No submit buttons
* No streaming
* No validation
* No auto-fill
* No inference
* No smart behavior

---

STOP CONDITION

Once the Prompt Box:

* renders correctly
* appears at the bottom of the left pane
* visually matches existing inputs
* reserves space for helper text and errors

STOP.
Do not continue further.

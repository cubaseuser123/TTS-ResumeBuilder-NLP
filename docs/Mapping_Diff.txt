TASK: Implement deterministic section mapping to prevent content duplication.
SCOPE IS STRICT — DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE.

CONTEXT
Resume content is currently duplicated across multiple sections (summary, experience, education, etc.).
This happens because raw text is being overlaid without strict section attribution.

ROOT CAUSE
There is normalization, but no deterministic mapping that assigns content to exactly one correct section.

REQUIRED FIX (ONLY IN FORMATTING AGENT)

* Implement strict section attribution:

  * Profile: contact + role fields only
  * Summary: short professional overview ONLY
  * Experience: structured entries (role, company, description, metrics)
  * Education: degree, institution, year ONLY
  * Skills: list of skills ONLY
  * Languages: list ONLY
  * Projects, Certificates, Awards, Publications, Volunteering, Interests:
    populate ONLY from their respective extracted content

* Prevent any section from inheriting or reusing full prompt text

* Do NOT copy summary text into experience or vice versa

* Each data point must exist in exactly one section

STRICT RULES

* Do NOT loosen QA
* Do NOT use Gemini or inference
* Do NOT modify frontend
* Do NOT change pipeline order

GOAL
Ensure clean, non-duplicated resume sections with correct attribution so UI renders correctly.

STOP once deterministic mapping is implemented.

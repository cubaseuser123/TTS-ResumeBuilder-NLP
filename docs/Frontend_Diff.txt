SCOPE (CRITICAL)
This task is FRONTEND-ONLY.
Do NOT touch backend, pipeline, agents, QA logic, or API contracts.

You are implementing loading UX + visual streaming AFTER data is ready.

CONTEXT

Items 1, 2, and 3 are complete:

Prompt box UI

Prompt submission & pipeline wiring

Clarification UI

Backend pipeline is strict, complete, and frozen

Backend returns either:

clarification questions

OR a fully formatted, QA-passed final_resume

There is NO backend streaming.

OBJECTIVE
Define and implement the UI behavior for:

While the pipeline is running

Immediately after the final resume JSON is received

Visually revealing resume content in the center pane

LOADING PHASE (PIPELINE RUNNING)

When a pipeline request is in-flight:

Center pane must show:

a loading animation OR

a skeleton resume layout (section headers only)

No resume content is rendered

No partial or stale data is shown

UI RULES:

Left pane inputs remain visible

Prompt box is disabled

Clicking anywhere does NOT affect the pipeline

No cancel / pause / resume logic

POST-GENERATION HANDLING (IMPORTANT)

Once the backend responds with final_resume:

Store the resume as an immutable snapshot

Do NOT mutate resume data during rendering

Do NOT re-call the backend

At this point, the pipeline is considered COMPLETE.

VISUAL STREAMING (FRONTEND-ONLY)

After final_resume is available:

Apply visual-only streaming (typewriter or reveal animation)

Streaming is purely presentational

Data source is already complete and final

Allowed:

Section-by-section reveal

Text typewriter effect

Small delay between sections

Not allowed:

Backend calls

Resume mutation

Streaming before data exists

Streaming implying “generation in progress”

Think:
Animation ≠ generation

STREAMING CONTROLS

Streaming must be:

fast

TEMPLATE INTERACTION

Template switching is allowed ONLY after:

resume exists

streaming has finished OR been skipped

Switching templates:

re-renders the same resume data

does NOT restart streaming

does NOT call backend

ERROR HANDLING (REMINDER)

If pipeline fails before resume is returned:

No streaming occurs

Center pane stays in loading / empty state

Error is shown below the prompt box (already implemented elsewhere)

EXPLICIT NON-GOALS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)

No backend streaming

No pause / resume

No partial resume rendering

No inline editing

No template logic beyond re-render

No new API calls

DONE CRITERIA

This task is complete when:

Center pane shows loading while pipeline runs

Final resume appears only after backend completion

Visual streaming happens AFTER data is ready

Streaming is skippable

Resume data remains unchanged throughout

STOP once this behavior is implemented.
